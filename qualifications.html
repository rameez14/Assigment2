<h2> What I am I currently doing? </h2>
<h4>I am an ambitious individual who is on a pursuit of gaining an undergraduate degree in Computer Science (BSc). I am currently aiming for a first-class honours degree at De Montfort University. I am currently completing a Hybrid project titled ‘First impression of web pages’   I will try to implement a way to show people web pages for very short phases of time, and then use it to study their perceptions of the web pages' attractiveness, usability and other properties such as professionalism and trustworthiness, this will allow me to understand how the design of the web page influences their first impressions. I will develop a hotel website where users can reserve a room and I will write a academic article regarding Human computer interaction. </h4>
